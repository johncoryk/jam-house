# JamHouse

## An app where indie developers can join and create game jams!

_-- A game jam is essentially a group of people creating games with certain constraints over a set amount of time. Creators then share their games and experiences during the jam! --_

**MVP:** The mvp of this app would include a way for users to signup/login to the application. Users would be able to either create new game jams or join an existing game jam. Once users sign up to participate in a game jam, they would be able to create a new page that tells a bit about the game they entered and host the game as well. Game jams would have a set time limit (ie. 1 week) and after the set amount of time would be considered ‘closed’.

**Reach Goals:** I would like to implement a ranking system that some other game jam platforms use now that would rank users based off of certain criteria that their game had (creativeness, gameplay, design, artwork, etc.). I also believe it will be difficult to figure out a way to embed games that run in the browser and let users do that client side, but this is what I’m shooting for.

**Users will be able to:**
Signup for an account if they do not have one.
Login with their credentials if they have an account.
See a dashboard with how many game jams they are running and are participating in.
Create a new game jam with a start and end date.
Sign up to be a part of another game jam.
Create a game page once signed up for a game jam and post their game and discussion there.
Rate other games during a game jam and leave feedback.

**Timeline (in days):**

1. Set up backend api, make sure all routes are working correctly. Database creation.
2. Start on frontend with React. Using dummy data to get views sorted out until connecting with backend api. Review what routes may or may not need to be added.
3. Add auth to application and continue to review what routes may or may not need to be changed/added.
4. Start the styling and add content to the frontend using the backend. Deploy application!
5. Testing and tweaking. Bug fixes.
6. Finish styling.
