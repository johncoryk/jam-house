# JamHouse

JamHouse is an application where game creators can connect, create game jams, and join game jams! No matter the platform, tech stack, or game engine, JamHouse let's users network and share projects and ideas with other game creators.

## Future Improvements

Though I'm happy with how the application looks and feels, there are a few goals I did not reach and a few things I'd love to implement down the road. A ranking system based off of creator feedback in regards to other creator's games would really take the application to another level and create a more exciting experience. I would also like to implement a way to embed HTML5 games right in the browser.
